    • Categorical Variable Definition: Categorical variables were defined in the dataset.

    • Duplicate Data Removal: Duplicate data in the dataset was identified and removed.

    • Outlier Detection and Removal using Z-Score: Outlier data was detected and removed using the Z-score.

    • Missing Value Handling: Missing values were identified and filled with the mode value.

    • Histogram Visualization: A histogram chart was created to visualize the distribution of prices.

    • Pair Plot Creation: A pair plot was created to visualize the relationship between all numerical variables and the price variable.

    • Categorical Variable Encoding: Label encoding and one-hot encoding were applied to categorical variables.

    • Model Training: A range of regression models was trained, which could have included:
       - Lasso Regression
       - Ridge Regression
       - Elastic Net Regression
       - K-Nearest Neighbors Regression
       - Random Forest Regression
       - Gradient Boosting Regression
       - AdaBoost Regression

    • Data Types Changed: The data types were modified as needed.

    • Empty Values Found and Replaced: Empty values were identified and replaced with appropriate data.

    • Duplicate Values Found and Removed: Duplicate values were identified and removed from the dataset.

    • Charts Created to Understand Data:
        - Bar charts, histograms, kernel density estimation (KDE) plots, and scatter charts were generated to gain insights into the data.

    •  Data Correlation Calculated and Heat Map Created: Data correlation was calculated, and a heatmap was generated to visualize the relationships between variables.
